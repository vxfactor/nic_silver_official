# Website Rebuild: Silver AI Consulting
## Complete Copy + Design Direction for Coding Agent

---

## DESIGN BRIEF FOR CODING AGENT

### Brand Personality
This is NOT a typical AI consulting website. No dark mode tech-bro aesthetics. No corporate blue gradients. No stock photos of people pointing at screens.

The vibe is: **confident, creative, warm, slightly irreverent, and unmistakably human.** Think the love child of a science lab and a recording studio. Smart but not stuffy. Professional but with personality.

### Design Direction
- Clean and modern but with warmth. Not sterile.
- Typography should feel distinctive and bold. Not generic SaaS fonts.
- Color palette: avoid the typical AI blue/purple/dark. Go warmer. Think contrast between something grounded and something energetic.
- Whitespace is your friend. Let the copy breathe.
- Subtle animations on scroll. Nothing flashy. Just enough to feel alive.
- Mobile-first. At least 60% of traffic will be mobile.
- Fast loading. Under 4 seconds or we lose them.
- One primary CTA throughout: Book a Discovery Call
- Secondary CTA for people not ready yet: "DM me DNA" or download the Authenticity Audit info

### Tone Check for Design
If the website looks like it could belong to Deloitte, McKinsey, or any SaaS startup founded in 2023... start over. If it looks like it belongs to someone with a record deal and a science background who genuinely enjoys what they do... you nailed it.

### SECTION 1: Hero

**Headline:**
Double your output without killing your brand.

**Subheadline:**
We help marketing and creative agencies scale content using AI that actually sounds like the brand wrote it. More clients. Same team. Better margins.

**CTA Button:**
Book a Discovery Call

**Secondary CTA (smaller, below):**
See how it works ↓

**Design notes:**
- Headline should be the dominant visual element. Big, bold, impossible to miss.
- No hero image needed. Let the typography do the heavy lifting.
- Subheadline in a lighter weight. Readable but not competing with the headline.
- Keep the hero section tight. No scrolling needed to see the CTA.

---

### SECTION 2: The Problem

**Section Label (small, above headline):**
Sound familiar?

**Headline:**
You're growing. Your content quality isn't.

**Body Copy:**
You started the agency because you're great at what you do. Now you're managing 6 brands across 4 platforms with a team that's running on caffeine and wishful thinking.

Every new client means more content. More content means more people. More people means higher costs. And somewhere along the way the work starts sounding... generic.

You've tried AI tools. The output reads like it was written by someone who skimmed your website for 30 seconds. Your clients can tell. You can definitely tell.

So you're stuck. Turn away clients or burn out your team. Grow revenue or protect quality. Scale or stay small.

What if that's a false choice?

**Design notes:**
- This section should feel like a conversation, not a sales pitch.
- Clean text on a slightly different background to create visual separation from the hero.
- No icons, no illustrations. Just copy that hits.

---

### SECTION 3: The Solution (Intro)

**Section Label:**
There's a better way

**Headline:**
Your brand has DNA. We make sure AI doesn't destroy it.

**Body Copy:**
Every brand has a voice that's unmistakably theirs. The way they phrase things. The humor they use. The words they'd never say. That voice is their DNA.

Most AI ignores it completely. That's why most AI content sounds like... AI content.

We do the opposite. We extract your brand's Voice DNA and build AI systems around it. So when you scale, every piece of content still sounds like your brand wrote it.

We call it Voice DNA Replication. And it changes everything about how agencies grow.

**CTA Button:**

### SECTION 4: How It Works (Overview)

**Headline:**
The Voice DNA Method

**Subheadline:**
Four steps. One goal: your brand voice, replicated perfectly at scale.

**Step 1:**
*Label:* Sequence
*Headline:* Decode your Voice DNA
*Copy:* We dig into what makes each brand sound like them. Not just tone and style. The beliefs, the rhythm, the vocabulary, the personality. Everything that makes someone read a post and go "yep, that's definitely them."

**Step 2:**
*Label:* Encode
*Headline:* Teach it to AI
*Copy:* We build custom AI systems with your Voice DNA baked in. The AI doesn't just write content about your brand. It writes content as your brand. Big difference.

**Step 3:**
*Label:* Replicate
*Headline:* Scale without mutations
*Copy:* Now you produce. Blog posts, social content, emails, ads. Every piece carries the full Voice DNA. Your team stops spending hours editing AI output to "make it sound right" because it already does.

**Step 4:**
*Label:* Verify
*Headline:* Check the fidelity
*Copy:* Every piece of content gets scored against the original Voice DNA using our Brand Voice Fidelity Score. We catch drift before it spreads. Your brand doesn't slowly mutate into something generic while nobody's watching.

**Design notes:**
- Present as a horizontal or vertical flow. Numbered steps with clear visual progression.
- Each step should feel distinct but connected.
- The biology terms (Sequence, Encode, Replicate, Verify) should be visually prominent. They're the proprietary language.
- Consider a subtle DNA-inspired visual element here. A helix, strand pattern, or something abstract. Nothing literal or cheesy.

### SECTION 5: Results / Social Proof

**Headline:**
The numbers don't lie. The content doesn't sound like AI either.

**Stats Row (big numbers, short labels):**

| Stat | Label |
|---|---|
| 3x | Revenue increase for clients |
| 20% | Boost in content engagement |
| 2x | Client capacity on the same team |
| Days | Not weeks. Content delivery time. |

**Subtext below stats:**
These aren't hypothetical projections. These are real results from real agencies who stopped choosing between quality and quantity.

**CTA Button:**
See the case studies

**Design notes:**
- Big, bold numbers. These should be the visual anchor of this section.
- Stats in a clean row or grid. Minimal decoration.
- High contrast background to make this section pop.

---

### SECTION 6: Testimonials

**Headline:**
Don't take our word for it

**Design notes:**
- Pull in 3 to 5 existing testimonials. Prioritize ones with specific results and real names.
- Card layout or carousel. Each testimonial should include: name, company/role, and the quote.
- If any testimonials mention specific outcomes (revenue, time saved, engagement), highlight those numbers visually.
- Keep it real. No stock headshots. Real photos or just text with names.

**[Nic to insert existing testimonials here]**

### SECTION 7: Who This Is For

**Headline:**
This is for you if...

**Body Copy:**
You run a marketing, content, or social media agency (1 to 15 people) and at least one of these keeps you up at night:

You're turning away clients because your team is maxed out.
Content quality is slipping and your clients are starting to notice.
Every AI tool you've tried produces stuff that sounds like it was written by a calculator.
Revenue is growing but your margins are shrinking because you keep hiring to keep up.
You want to scale but not at the cost of what makes your agency good.

If you're nodding at any of those, we should talk.

**CTA Button:**
Book a Discovery Call

**Design notes:**
- Present the "keeps you up at night" items as a clean list, not bullets. Short lines, stacked vertically.
- This section should feel personal and direct. Like Nic is talking to one person.

---

### SECTION 8: The Guarantee

**Headline:**
The Voice DNA Guarantee

**Body Copy:**
If your audience can tell it's AI, we rebuild the system at no extra cost.

That's not a throwaway promise. We're confident enough in the Voice DNA method to put our money where our mouth is. If the content our system produces doesn't pass a blind test against human-written brand content, we go back to the lab and re-engineer it until it does.

Most AI consultants would never make this guarantee. We're not most AI consultants.

**Design notes:**
- This section should stand out visually. A different background color or a bordered card.
- The guarantee headline should feel bold and confident, not corporate-cautious.

---

### SECTION 9: About (Short Version)

**Headline:**
The short version

**Body Copy:**
I'm Nic. Ex-biomedical researcher (15 years studying DNA replication across Scandinavia and England). Ex-music producer (actual record deal). Serial entrepreneur (nightclubs, e-commerce, fitness brands, the works).

When AI hit, something clicked. The problem agencies face scaling content, voice degrading, identity getting lost, everything sounding the same, is a replication problem. The same thing I spent years studying in a lab. Different domain, same challenge.

So I built Voice DNA Replication. A method that borrows from how biology solves the scaling problem and applies it to brand voice.

Scientific precision meets creative instinct. That's what I bring to every project.

**Design notes:**
- Warm, personal section. If there's a photo of Nic, this is where it goes.
- The photo should match the brand energy. Not a corporate headshot. Something real and personable.

## PAGE: ABOUT (Full Version)

---

**Headline:**
Part scientist. Part artist. Fully obsessed with AI that doesn't suck.

**Body Copy:**

I spent 15 years in biomedical research across Norway, Sweden, and England. My days were spent in labs studying how DNA replicates. How cells copy themselves perfectly, billions of times, without losing a single piece of what makes them unique. I published papers. Got international recognition. Wore a lot of lab coats.

Then I got a record deal as a music producer. Traded the lab for studios and late nights.

Then I caught the entrepreneurship bug. Built nightclubs (Club Le Fou). Launched an e-commerce jewelry brand (Bird by Silver). Created fitness brands. Started a networking community for entrepreneurs in Trondheim (Nove Network).

And then AI happened.

I watched every agency, brand, and creator rush to adopt AI for content. And I watched the output get worse. Generic. Soulless. The kind of content that technically checks all the boxes but makes you feel nothing.

The problem was obvious to me in a way it wouldn't be to most people: this is a replication problem. When you scale without preserving the original code, you get mutations. The output looks right but something's off. It's the same challenge I'd spent over a decade studying, just in a completely different context.

So I built Voice DNA Replication. A methodology that sequences what makes a brand's voice unique, encodes it into AI systems, and ensures it replicates with full fidelity at scale. No mutations. No drift. No robotic aftertaste.

Now I help marketing and creative agencies double their content output on the same team with better margins and content that actually sounds like the brand wrote it.

I speak Norwegian, Swedish, and English. I'm based in Trondheim, Norway. And I still believe that the best work happens when scientific rigor and creative instinct are in the same room.

## PAGE: HOW IT WORKS (Detailed)

---

**Headline:**
How Voice DNA Replication works

**Subheadline:**
The method behind the results. Four phases. One goal: your brand voice at scale, with nothing lost in translation.

---

**Phase 1: Sequence**

*Headline:* First, we decode your Voice DNA

*Copy:*
Before you can replicate anything, you need to understand the original code.

We analyze your brand's existing content, interview your team, study your audience's language, and map the patterns that make your brand unmistakably yours. Not just "professional and friendly" type stuff. We go deeper. Beliefs. Rhythms. Vocabulary. Humor. Values. The invisible things that make someone read a post and know it's you without seeing the logo.

*Deliverable:* Your Brand Voice DNA Map. A complete decoded profile of what makes your brand sound like your brand.

---

**Phase 2: Encode**

*Headline:* Then, we teach AI to speak your language

*Copy:*
This is where most people get AI wrong. They open ChatGPT, type "write a post about our product," and get something that sounds like it was generated by someone who read your website for two minutes.

That's because they're asking AI to write without giving it the DNA.

We build custom AI systems, including prompts, workflows, context libraries, and guardrails, all encoded with your Voice DNA. The AI doesn't just write content. It writes content as your brand. That distinction is everything.

*Deliverable:* Your Voice DNA Engine. A fully built content system trained on your brand's unique voice.

---

**Phase 3: Replicate**

*Headline:* Now, you scale

*Copy:*
Blog posts. Social content. Email campaigns. Ad copy. Newsletters. Whatever you need, produced at a pace that used to require twice the team.

Every piece carries the full Voice DNA because the system was built from it. Your team stops spending hours editing AI output to "make it sound right" because it already does.

This is where agencies go from drowning in client work to doubling their roster without adding a single hire.

*Deliverable:* Content at volume. Produced faster, more consistently, and with higher voice accuracy than human-only workflows.

---

**Phase 4: Verify**

*Headline:* We check the fidelity. Every time.

*Copy:*
In biology, cells have error-checking mechanisms that catch mutations before they spread. We do the same thing.

Every piece of content is scored against the original Voice DNA using our Brand Voice Fidelity Score. If something's drifting, we catch it early. Quality stays locked in. Your brand doesn't slowly mutate into something generic while nobody's watching.

*Deliverable:* Ongoing Fidelity Reports. Measurable proof that voice quality is holding or improving over time.

---

**Bottom CTA:**

*Headline:* Want to see what this looks like for your agency?

*Copy:*
Book a discovery call and I'll walk you through how Voice DNA Replication would work for your specific brands, team, and workflow. No jargon. No pitch decks. Just a real conversation.
