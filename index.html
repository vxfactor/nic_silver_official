            <p>Meanwhile, your content calendar is a graveyard of good intentions. Every piece still runs through you because nothing else can nail your voice. And hiring a full creative team? Six figures before anyone's even published a post.</p>

            <h2 class="section-headline">I've Built Businesses Across Five Industries. Now I Build the AI Systems That Scale Them.</h2>
            <p>I'm Nic Silver — an AI systems builder based in Trondheim, Norway.</p>
            <p>Before I got into AI, I spent 15 years in biomedical research, had a record deal as a music producer, and built multiple businesses from scratch in industries that have nothing in common except that they all required figuring things out from zero.</p>
            <p>That's the thread. I'm a builder. I've always been a builder. When AI hit, I didn't see a shortcut — I saw a new material to build with.</p>
            <p>I started Silver AI Consulting because I watched an entire industry rush to automate everything and ask questions later. Everyone was talking about speed and scale. Nobody was talking about whether the output was actually any good — or whether it sounded anything like the brand it was supposed to represent.</p>
            <p>That's the gap I fill. I combine scientific rigour with creative instinct to build AI systems that don't just produce more — they produce the right output, in your voice, for your audience.</p>
