## Section 01 — Hero + Navigation

**Design:** Clean, editorial feel. Professional headshot or abstract brand visual. No stock photos.

### Nav Bar
Silver AI Consulting | Services • About • Newsletter | [Book a Strategy Session] (button)

### Eyebrow
AI solutions for creative brands that want results, not gimmicks

### Headline (H1)

### Sub-headline

## Section 02 — Problem Statement

**Design:** Subtle contrast from white — very light warm grey or off-white background to create visual separation. Let the words breathe. No images — let the copy do the heavy lifting.

### Eyebrow
Sound familiar?

### Headline
Stuck Between Doing Everything Yourself and Tools That Don't Get You

### Body Copy
You've tried the AI tools. They produce words — just not *your* words. You spend as long editing the output as you would have writing it from scratch.

Meanwhile, your content calendar is a graveyard of good intentions. Every piece still runs through you because nothing else can nail your voice. And hiring a full creative team? Six figures before anyone's even published a post.

So you stay stuck — burning out, leaving growth on the table, choosing between your sanity and your standards.

### Transition
There's a better way. Not another tool or another hire. A system built around your brand from the ground up.

---

## Section 03 — Solution / Methodology

**Design:** Three or four-column card layout for the solution types. Clean iconography. Should feel methodical and premium.

### Eyebrow
How I solve it

### Headline
I Build Custom AI Systems That Work the Way Your Brand Thinks

### Body Copy
I don't sell you a tool and wish you luck. I study how your brand communicates — your voice, your rhythm, your audience — and then I build the systems that turn that understanding into scalable output.

Every solution starts with a deep analysis of your brand's creative DNA that goes far beyond a style guide or a prompt template. That foundation powers everything.

### What I Build (card layout)

**Custom AI Apps**
Purpose-built tools designed for your specific workflow, not someone else's

**Content & Marketing Systems**
Automated pipelines that turn your ideas, meetings, and conversations into publish-ready output across platforms

**AI Video Production**
Professional video created through AI, at a fraction of the traditional cost and turnaround time

**Voice & Brand Preservation**
Systems that capture your writing fingerprint so every piece sounds unmistakably like you

---

## Section 04 — What I Build

**Design:** Card-based layout for solution types. Tasty Slurp gets a subtle visual distinction — bordered callout or different background — but stays within the section flow.

### Eyebrow
Solutions, not packages

### Headline
Every Brand Is Different. Every System I Build Is Too.

### Body Copy
I don't sell off-the-shelf packages. I build custom solutions based on what your brand actually needs to grow. Here's what that typically looks like:

### Custom AI Apps
Need a tool that doesn't exist yet? I build purpose-built AI applications tailored to your workflow — whether that's a content repurposing engine, an AI-powered brief generator, or something nobody's thought of yet.

### Content & Marketing Systems
I design end-to-end pipelines that turn your raw ideas, calls, and conversations into publish-ready output across every platform. Less manual work. More consistent results.

### AI Video Production
Professional video created through AI — from strategy to finished product. The quality of a production team at a fraction of the cost and turnaround time.

### Voice & Brand Preservation
Systems that learn how you write, speak, and think — so every piece of AI-generated output sounds unmistakably like you. Not a chatbot. Not a template. You.

### Done For You (Tasty Slurp callout)
Need someone to run it all? Tasty Slurp is my AI creative agency — a lean, human-led team that handles your creative strategy, production, and distribution using the same systems I build. You stay focused on your business.

### CTA
Every project starts with a conversation. [Book a Strategy Session] — 30 minutes, no pitch, just clarity on what's possible.

## Section 05 — Authority & About

**Design:** Professional headshot of Nic. Credentials as icon badges or a clean stat bar. This section should feel personal and grounded.

### Nic's Headshot

### Eyebrow
Why me

### Headline
I've Built Businesses Across Five Industries. Now I Build the AI Systems That Scale Them.

### Body Copy
I'm Nic Silver — an AI systems builder based in Trondheim, Norway.

Before I got into AI, I spent 15 years in biomedical research, had a record deal as a music producer, and built multiple businesses from scratch in industries that have nothing in common except that they all required figuring things out from zero.

That's the thread. I'm a builder. I've always been a builder. When AI hit, I didn't see a shortcut — I saw a new material to build with.

I started Silver AI Consulting because I watched an entire industry rush to automate everything and ask questions later. Everyone was talking about speed and scale. Nobody was talking about whether the output was actually any good — or whether it sounded anything like the brand it was supposed to represent.

That's the gap I fill. I combine scientific rigour with creative instinct to build AI systems that don't just produce more — they produce the right output, in your voice, for your audience.

## Section 06 — How It Works

**Design:** Numbered timeline or horizontal step flow. Clean and visual. Each step should feel achievable and low-risk.

### Eyebrow
The process

### Headline
Three Steps From First Call to Real Results

### Step 1 — Strategy Session
A focused 30-minute call where I learn how your brand operates, where the bottlenecks are, and what growth looks like for you. You'll walk away with a clear picture of what's possible — whether we work together or not.

### Step 2 — Find the Right Fit
Every brand is different, and so is every engagement. Maybe you need me to build the system. Maybe you need guidance to build it yourself. Maybe it's somewhere in between. We figure out what makes sense for your situation, your budget, and your goals.

### Step 3 — Execute & Scale
Whether I'm building it, advising on it, or a mix of both — you get a working system that produces real results. Faster creative output, lower costs, and workflows that scale without sacrificing quality or your brand's identity.

### CTA
It starts with a conversation. [Book Your Strategy Session] — 30 minutes that will change how you think about AI in your business.

## Section 07 — Lead Magnet + Newsletter

**Design:** Visually distinct section — light background. Email form should be dead simple: one field, one button. Consider a mockup of the Notion workspace.

### Eyebrow
Free resource

### Headline
Get the Brand Codex — My Complete System for Creating On-Brand Content With AI

### Body Copy
Not ready for a call? Start here. The Brand Codex is the same system I use with clients to make sure AI-generated content actually sounds like the brand it's supposed to represent. It's not a checklist — it's a complete, ready-to-use framework built in Notion.

### Email Form (Flodesk Embed)

⚠️ **Do not** wrap the form in any extra layout or container. Do not add any heading or text around it. Do not apply any styles. Keep Flodesk's original style.
⚠️ **Do not** embed the form inside any other section. It lives in this section only.

Create a separate component and import it into `src/pages/Index.tsx`:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function NewsletterForm() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Inject Flodesk script into <head> if not already present
    const existingScript = document.querySelector('script[src*="flodesk"]');
    if (!existingScript) {
      (function(w, d, t, h, s, n) {
        w.FlodeskObject = n;
        var fn = function() {
          (w[n].q = w[n].q || []).push(arguments);
        };
        w[n] = w[n] || fn;
        var f = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];
        var v = '?v=' + Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / (120 * 1000)) * 60;
        var sm = d.createElement(t);
        sm.async = true;
        sm.type = 'module';
        sm.src = h + s + '.mjs' + v;
        f.parentNode.insertBefore(sm, f);
        var sn = d.createElement(t);
        sn.async = true;
        sn.noModule = true;
        sn.src = h + s + '.js' + v;
        f.parentNode.insertBefore(sn, f);
      })(window, document, 'script', 'https://assets.flodesk.com', '/universal', 'fd');
    }

    // Initialize the form
    window.fd('form', {
      formId: '6971eaa95705353f2cd054e0',
      containerEl: '#fd-form-6971eaa95705353f2cd054e0'
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div id="fd-form-6971eaa95705353f2cd054e0"></div>
  );
}
```

## Section 08 — Final CTA

**Design:** Full-width section. Consider a subtle accent gradient or light background shift to signal this is the final moment. Should feel like a moment of decision while staying clean and premium.
